<h1>Slowly but surely</h1>
<div class=intro-content><p>There were times when I thought I would never get there. Regular measurements of speed were useless. Extended moments of gradual forward leaning blurred the lines between stasis and motion. Sounds deepened in pitch. Low light left rings around my focused stare as I struggled with balance.</p>
<p>I was in a state of flux. I was in a state of flux.
I was in a state of flux.</p>
<p>This was the state of flux.</p>
