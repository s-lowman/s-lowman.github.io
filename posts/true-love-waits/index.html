<p>I&rsquo;d drown my eyes in tears = I&rsquo;d cry a lot. I&rsquo;d drown my sorrows = I&rsquo;d drink a lot to forget my problems. I&rsquo;d drown my sorrows in alcohol = I&rsquo;d drink a lot of alcohol to forget my problems. I&rsquo;d drown my sorrows in alcohol = I&rsquo;d drink a lot of alcohol to forget my problems. Drown in your sorrows = to be very sad.</p>
<p>Do you know the difference between drown and drown in?</p>

<h2 id=differences>Differences</h2>
<p>There is a difference between being clumsy and being lumbering. Lumbering is moving slowly and clumsily. It is a verb, but it is also a noun. That means it occupies the space between movement and being. Clumsiness is a type of playfulness with intention of movement. As you slow it down, clumsy movement reveals itself as a form of being.</p>
<p>In the same way, the word &ldquo;drown&rdquo; is a verb, but it is also a noun. It occupies the space between movement and being. Drowning is a movement with no continuation. As you slow it down, drowning reveals itself as a form of being at the end of being.</p>
<p>Slipping into the water is a movement. Slipping in meaning as you perceive it too closely is the movement of language as it slows down and becomes being. Communication is the form of being as it moves into the world and becomes absorbed. It is lost as it becomes absorbed.</p>
<h2 id=similarities>Similarities</h2>
<p>Occupying space is the primary indication of existence when perceived from outside of consciousness.</p>
<p>Space is the form of being as it moves into the world and becomes absorbed. It is lost as it becomes absorbed. Space is both the form of being and the form of movement.</p>
